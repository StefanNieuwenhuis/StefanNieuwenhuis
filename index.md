Welcome! I'm **Stefan Nieuwenhuis**, a Machine Learning Engineer building and documenting real-world systems to deepen my skills and share what I learn.

This blog is split into three main series:

- 💡 **[Recommender System](/categories/recommender-system/)** – building a real-time recommender from scratch with Docker Compose, Spark, Redis/Faiss, and FastAPI.
- ⚙️ **[Homelab](/categories/homelab/)** – setting up a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster with refurbished hardware.
- 🧠 **[DSA Refresh](/categories/dsa/)** – revisiting data structures and algorithms with a focus on problem solving and pattern recognition.

> Everything is built **publicly**, with full transparency into tradeoffs, failures, and wins.
> Follow along — or contribute!
